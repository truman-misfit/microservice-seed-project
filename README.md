![Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/truman-misfit/microservice-seed-project.svg?branch=master)

This is a archetype project (or seed project) for building up micro-service in Misfit Cloud.

# Features
* BDD with cucumber
* Documentation with Swagger
* Message Queue encapsulated with modules

# Requirements
* Java 1.8.0_05 or above
* Scala 2.11.6 or above
* Activator 1.3.4 or above
* sbt 0.13.8 or above

# Install
**1. Install [JavaSE](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) (Java 1.8.0_05 or above)**

**2. Install [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/download/) (Scala 2.11.6 or above)**

**3. Install [Activator](https://www.typesafe.com/get-started) (Activator 1.3.4 or above)**

Both mini-package and full-package are OK.

**4. Fix local dependency**

Since the latest public version of cucumber-plugin repo has some compatible problems, you need to compile and publish the xsbt-cucumber-plugin to local by yourself. The repo is [turman-misfit/xsbt-cucumber-pulgin](https://github.com/truman-misfit/xsbt-cucumber-plugin).

* **Step 1**. `git clone https://github.com/truman-misfit/xsbt-cucumber-plugin.git`
* **Step 2**. `cd xsbt-cucumber-plugin`
* **Step 3**. `sbt publish-local`

Then you will find the dependency published in the directory of your defualt ivy local path, for example, `~/.ivy2/local` on my MacBook Pro.

The configuration below in the `play.plugins` file will default look up the specific local ivy path.

```
resolvers += Resolver.file("Local repo", file(System.getProperty("user.home") + "/.ivy2/local"))(Resolver.ivyStylePatterns)

addSbtPlugin("templemore" % "sbt-cucumber-plugin" % "0.9.0-SNAPSHOT")
```

**5. Git pull repo**

* **Step 1**. pull repo
```
git clone https://github.com/truman-misfit/microservice-seed-project.git

```

* **Step 2**. activator run
```
cd misms-seed-project
activator run
```
Open the page `http://localhost:9000/swagger` to checkout whether swagger is up and running.

Or you can test cucumber by following the commands below:
```
activator cucumber
```

# Future
**1. Unified resource adapter**

A sophisticated AWS resource adapter layer should be considered in the seed project. Since our tech stack dependends on AWS resource, it is necessary to integrate the resource adapter into seed project. BTW, the credentials and the configurations sharing problems should be handled within the adapter layer in the future improvement.

Such layer will contain:
1. Unified Cache Module.
2. Unified Data Store Accessment.
3. Unified Asynchronous Kinesis Client.
*4. Unified Configuration Sharing Strategy. (Maybe based on zookeeper cluster)*

**2. Travis-CI and Coverall**

Travis-CI and Coverall will be a good way to involve other developers making contributions for this seed project.

**3. Docker Compose**

Docker Compose and Activator Package integration.
